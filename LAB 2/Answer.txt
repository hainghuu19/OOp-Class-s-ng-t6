Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: If we do this, Java will notify us that the method (constructor), which indicates that Java has 
designated it as an error and will prevent the program from running later, has been duplicated. 
When using the Aims.java file to test these constructors, the outcome is a little bit different. 
Although a window appeared warning that there were issues with the AimsProject, there was still a choice to 
launch the satellite. Due to the title constructor having precedence over the category constructor, the "title"
attribute was filled upon startup while the category was set to null.
